/* 1. Pick your favorite movie.
      Create an object below named myMovie with properties that represent the information (title, genre, year)

*/





/* 2. Write another line of code that adds a new property to your movie called netflix and set it to true or false based on if the movie can currently be found on Netflix.
     (Note: Don't modify your movie creation code that you wrote above! Do this step in a separate line of code.)
     *Remember, true or false are boolean data types
*/




/* 3. Add and define a method (function inside of a property) to your movie called playMovie() that prints "The movie is now playing on Netflix" or "The movie is unavailable on Netflix" based on the netflix property.
    (Note: Again, don't modify your previous code! Do this step by writing a new line of code.)
